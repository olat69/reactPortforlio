export const HERO_CONTENT = `A Full-Stack Software Engineer transforming ideas into scalable digital experiences across web and mobile platforms.
With 3+ years of specialized experience in the software development ecosystem, I architect and develop high-performance applications that bridge the gap between innovative design and robust functionality. My expertise spans the complete development lifecycle—from responsive web interfaces built with React and Next.js to cross-platform mobile applications using React Native.
Core Competencies
-Frontend Excellence: JavaScript (ES6+), React, Next.js, React Native. -Backend Mastery: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful API design, Python, FAST api. -Database Solutions: SQL and NoSql, data modeling and optimization. -Mobile Development: Native iOS/Android experiences via React Native, -Testing & Debugging: Jest, Pytest, Postman, Swagger Docs .
I specialize in creating seamless user experiences while maintaining clean, maintainable codebases that scale with business growth. My approach combines technical precision with strategic thinking to deliver solutions that not only meet current requirements but anticipate future needs.
Ready to turn your vision into reality through code.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `My journey into software development started with a simple question: "How does this work?" That curiosity has driven me through 3+ years of self-directed learning and hands-on project development, transforming from someone who wondered about code to someone who crafts solutions with it. What sets me apart is my adaptability—I'm equally productive working independently on focused coding sessions and collaborating in team environments where ideas flow freely. I'm a natural problem-solver who thrives on breaking down complex challenges into manageable components, and I've learned that great software emerges from clear communication, active listening, and the ability to translate technical concepts into language that stakeholders understand.

When faced with new technologies or frameworks, I don't just learn the syntax—I dive deep to understand the underlying principles. This approach has served me well as I've expanded my toolkit beyond the M.E.R.N stack to include Python and its framework Fast API, allowing me to choose the right tool for each project's unique requirements. Whether I'm leading a sprint, pair programming, or heads-down in solo development, I adapt my communication style to what the situation demands. I believe in writing clean, documented code not just for myself, but for the next developer who might work on the project, and my enthusiasm for continuous learning means I'm always exploring emerging technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of my solutions., 
 and contributing to projects.`;
